Once the df's are merged you can proceed to deleting any rows with null values. At that point we need to validate that the API pulls are consistent with the Netflix.csv(i.e. or flix df). In order to validate, make sure that both \"Pulled_Release_Date\" and \"Premiere\" columns are the same. Should dates be found to be inconsistent, we can look into removing those rows altogether (or running another API pull on the inconsistent data set, which should be smaller and merging it back into the larger, more consistent data set). Sorry I couldn't get us further along, but I think we've got a decent start here. Will be in commuinication later today, for an update.\n",
